# Teaching LLMs to Run an Incident Command Center

> *India's Biggest Mega AI Hackathon — Built on Meta OpenEnv · Round 2*

**TL;DR** — I built an [OpenEnv](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/openenv) environment where three specialist agents — **Triage**, **Investigator**, and **Ops Manager** — cooperate to resolve real-world tech incidents under SLA pressure, budget constraints, and customer-tier business impact. I then fine-tuned Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct on heuristic rollouts and watched it **close a +10.17-reward gap on hard incidents**, matching the hand-coded expert policy component-for-component. A separate 0.5B ablation shows that **model scale is the story** — same pipeline, same data schema, but the smaller backbone never closes a single hard incident.

## 1. The story in 2 minutes (for anyone)

**When a real tech company has an outage, three people's phones buzz at once.** A Triage engineer scans logs and dashboards. An Investigator forms a hypothesis and applies a fix. An Ops Manager decides who owns the work, whether to escalate, and when to officially close the incident.

Each role has **different permissions**, **different information needs**, and a **different clock to beat**. Get it wrong and you bleed budget, bust the SLA, and — if the customer is on an enterprise contract — lose serious money (~3× what a free-tier outage costs).

I built a simulator of that war room — an **OpenEnv-compatible** environment with 13 realistic incidents, 3 specialist roles, and 14+ named reward signals — and fine-tuned an LLM to run it.

| Role | Can do | Cannot do |
|---|---|---|
| 🔍 **Triage agent** | Pull logs · check metrics · consult KB articles | Close a ticket |
| 🧪 **Investigator** | Apply a fix · roll back a deploy | Escalate or file a post-mortem |
| 👷 **Ops Manager** | Escalate · file post-mortem · **close the ticket** | Apply a code fix |

> **The headline number:** the fine-tuned LLM earns **+10.17 more reward on hard incidents** than the untrained base — and matches the human-written expert policy component-for-component.

![Reward curve comparing random, base LLM, fine-tuned LLM, and heuristic on easy, medium, and hard tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwapnilPatil28/Multi-Agent-Incident-Command-Center/main/artifacts/reward_curve.png)

One picture, four policies, three difficulty tiers. Random is the floor. The untuned base LLM plateaus because it never learns to actually **close** an incident. The fine-tuned model climbs sharply with difficulty and catches the hand-coded expert exactly.

---

## 2. Why this is a real RL problem (three themes in one environment)

Most RL environments for LLMs are single-agent, single-step, or turn-based games. Real enterprise work is none of those. This environment deliberately tests all three Round-2 hackathon themes simultaneously:

| Hackathon theme | How this environment satisfies it |
|---|---|
| **🤝 #1 — Multi-Agent Interactions** | Three distinct specialist roles with **non-overlapping permissions**. Acting out-of-role triggers a `wrong_actor_penalty` (−0.08). Correct handoffs earn `+0.15`. Collaboration is **trained**, not hard-coded. |
| **⏱️ #2 — Long-Horizon Planning** | Each episode carries **3–5 sequential incidents**, 20–60 steps apiece, under a single ticking SLA clock. The big reward (+0.80 × tier) only fires after clues → fix → post-mortem. **Sparse and delayed by design** — the 20-step credit-assignment problem is the whole point. |
| **🏢 #3 — World Modeling / Professional Tasks** | Incidents carry **real logs, metrics, KB articles, red-herring signals**, and **business metadata** (customer tier, affected users, $/min revenue impact). Closure rewards scale by tier (free ×0.6 · standard ×1.0 · premium ×1.4 · **enterprise ×1.8**), and wrong closures are punished the same way. Close an enterprise ticket incorrectly and it hurts **~3× what a free-tier one does**. |

## 3. What the environment looks like under the hood

The environment runs as a standard OpenEnv FastAPI server — same Gym-style `reset / step` contract, same Pydantic observation/action schemas, same Docker image format for Hugging Face Spaces.

### Observation (partial)

```json
{
  "incident_id": "inc-cert-expiry",
  "incident_title": "mTLS cert expired — all microservices throwing 500s",
  "incident_description": "Alerting fired at 03:12 UTC ...",
  "customer_tier": "enterprise",
  "affected_users_estimate": 140000,
  "revenue_impact_usd_per_min": 4800,
  "postmortem_required": true,
  "visible_signals": ["mtls handshake errors", "5xx spike in checkout"],
  "investigation_targets": {
    "logs": ["cert-manager", "auth-service"],
    "metrics": ["dash-mesh", "dash-auth"],
    "kb": ["kb-mtls-chain", "kb-cert-rotation"]
  },
  "allowed_actors_by_action": {
    "apply_fix": ["investigator_agent"],
    "close_incident": ["ops_manager_agent"]
  },
  "budget_remaining": 18,
  "sla_minutes_remaining": 40,
  "clues_found": 2,
  "mitigation_applied": false,
  "reward_components": {"step_cost": -0.04, "clue_bonus": +0.12}
}
```

### Action space

| action_type | Typical actor | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `inspect_logs` / `inspect_metrics` / `consult_kb` | triage / investigator | Gather clues (reward shapes here) |
| `negotiate_handoff` | ops_manager | Route to correct owner |
| `apply_fix` | investigator | Apply mitigation (scored vs ground truth) |
| `rollback` | investigator | Revert last change |
| `escalate` | ops_manager | Engage senior staff |
| `submit_postmortem` | ops_manager | Required on tier-1 / high-revenue incidents |
| `close_incident` | ops_manager | Terminal action — final score depends on clues found + mitigation quality + post-mortem + speed |

### Reward rubric (composable, not monolithic)

The reward engine emits **named components** at every step so training curves — and judges — can see *exactly where reward came from*:

| Component | When it fires | Sign |
|---|---|---|
| `step_cost` | Every action (−0.01 to −0.08 by action type) | − |
| `clue_bonus` | Unique log/metric/KB lookup that surfaces a real fact | **+** |
| `handoff_correct` / `handoff_wrong` | Ops manager routes to allowed / disallowed owner | ± |
| `mitigation_correct` / `mitigation_wrong` / `mitigation_empty` | Fix matches / contradicts / omits ground-truth keywords | ± |
| `rollback_effective` / `rollback_ineffective` | Rollback summary matches the incident's accepted playbook | ± |
| `escalation_needed` / `escalation_not_needed` | Escalation raised for an incident that actually warrants it | ± |
| `closure_correct` / `closure_wrong` | Final close decision matches incident state | ± (scaled by customer tier) |
| `closure_mitigation_bonus` | Close after a correct mitigation | **+** |
| `closure_under_investigated` | Close without enough clues found | − |
| `speed_bonus` | Close in ≤ 7 / ≤ 4 steps | **+** |
| `postmortem_bonus` / `postmortem_missing` | Post-mortem filed / skipped on a high-impact incident | ± |
| `repeated_lookup_penalty` | Re-querying the same log/metric/KB | − |
| `wrong_actor_penalty` | Action invoked by a role that's not authorised | − |
| `invalid_action` | Unrecognised `action_type` | − |
| `sla_exhausted` / `budget_exhausted` | Terminal penalty when SLA / action budget hits zero | − |

**Anti-gaming:** closing early with zero clues is penalised; spamming cheap `inspect_logs` racks up `repeated_lookup_penalty`; triggering `apply_fix` without investigator permissions gives `wrong_actor_penalty`. A policy cannot shortcut its way to a high score.

## 4. Training: HF TRL SFT on heuristic rollouts

I first wrote a deterministic `HeuristicCoordinator` that uses the observation's `investigation_targets` and role constraints to play through the environment. On hard tasks it earns **+5.89** reward where random scores **−12.50** — so that gives us ~680 `(prompt, completion)` pairs of "good" behavior to imitate.

Training script: [`train_trl.py`](https://github.com/SwapnilPatil28/Multi-Agent-Incident-Command-Center/blob/main/train_trl.py). One command on Colab T4 (or **[open the reproducible notebook ↗](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vx9E5FrZZrHoRwXs2cvtom3DaI6kZ3LP?usp=sharing)**) runs the entire pipeline:

```python
os.environ["BASE_MODEL"]         = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"
os.environ["EPISODES_PER_TASK"]  = "8"
os.environ["TRAIN_EPOCHS"]       = "3"
os.environ["EVAL_LLM_MODELS"]    = "true"
os.environ["MAX_LLM_EVAL_STEPS"] = "120"
!python train_trl.py
```

The script:

1. Rolls out the heuristic against the live environment and collects prompts/completions.
2. Runs TRL `SFTTrainer` with a single `text` column (chat-template applied).
3. Saves the fine-tuned checkpoint to `artifacts/sft_model/`.
4. Rolls out **four** policies under identical seeds — random, heuristic, base LLM, fine-tuned LLM.
5. Writes `reward_curve.png`, `training_curve.png`, `reward_components.png`, `summary_metrics.json`, and `training_log.json`.

### Training loss + token accuracy

![SFT training loss dropping from ~2.84 to ~0.02 and token accuracy climbing from ~0.49 to ~0.99 over 3 epochs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwapnilPatil28/Multi-Agent-Incident-Command-Center/main/artifacts/training_curve.png)

Loss drops from **~2.84 → ~0.02** over three epochs as the model learns the structured JSON action format. Mean token accuracy climbs from **~0.49 → ~0.99**. Satisfies the hackathon "loss AND reward plots" minimum requirement.

### Four-policy reward comparison

![Reward curve comparing random, base LLM, fine-tuned LLM, and heuristic on easy, medium, and hard tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwapnilPatil28/Multi-Agent-Incident-Command-Center/main/artifacts/reward_curve.png)

| Task | Random | Base LLM | **Fine-tuned (SFT)** | Heuristic |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| easy | −5.96 | −2.92 | **−4.72** | −4.72 |
| medium | −11.48 | −4.00 | **−0.87** | −0.87 |
| hard | −12.50 | −4.28 | **+5.89** | +5.89 |

**Fine-tuned vs untrained base: +10.17 reward delta on hard-difficulty incidents.**

- **Random** is the floor on every task.
- **Base LLM** already beats random on easy because it produces well-formed-ish JSON — but it never closes a single incident, so it just racks up step-costs and SLA penalties.
- **Fine-tuned LLM** catches the heuristic teacher exactly. The environment is deterministic and SFT hit ~0.99 token accuracy, so the student literally reproduces the teacher's action sequence under greedy decoding. This is **imitation learning converging to the expert** — the meaningful headline number is therefore **SFT vs base**, not SFT vs heuristic.

### Reward sources — what each policy actually earns

![Stacked-bar chart showing where each policy earns or loses reward, broken down by rubric component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwapnilPatil28/Multi-Agent-Incident-Command-Center/main/artifacts/reward_components.png)

This is the chart I'm proudest of, because it makes the training signal **legible**. Summed across all three tasks:

- **Random** bleeds out: `closure_wrong: −17.82` · `wrong_actor_penalty: −3.12` · `mitigation_wrong: −2.10`.
- **Base LLM** earns `clue_bonus: +0.24` but then gets crushed by `step_cost: −5.16` and `sla_exhausted: −5.04`. It **never fires a single positive closure component**.
- **Fine-tuned LLM** unlocks the high-value positive components the base never sees: `closure_correct: +7.36` · `mitigation_correct: +2.10` · `closure_mitigation_bonus: +1.80` · `postmortem_bonus: +0.60` · `handoff_correct: +0.75` · `speed_bonus: +0.60`.

**Training has moved the LLM from "bleeding" to "solving."**

---

## 5. Why does SFT exactly match the heuristic?

Honest framing matters. The environment is deterministic (same task → same incidents → same observations → same seeds). The heuristic coordinator is also deterministic (same observation → same action). So every rollout of a given task produces a byte-identical trajectory. Our 680-row dataset contains only ~85 *unique* `(observation, action)` pairs, each duplicated for redundancy. At ~0.99 token accuracy after 3 epochs, the LLM **memorises** the heuristic's policy, and under greedy decoding at eval time it reproduces that policy token-for-token on the same deterministic environment.

> **This is the defining success condition for behavior cloning: the student has become the teacher.**

The gap we can legitimately celebrate is therefore **SFT vs the untrained base model**, where:

- On **hard incidents**, SFT earns **+10.17** more reward than base.
- SFT **unlocks** reward components (`closure_correct`, `mitigation_correct`, `postmortem_bonus`) that the base model literally never fires.
- On easy tasks, SFT inherits the teacher's known weakness (easy tasks have tight SLA budgets that punish thorough investigation). This is exactly what imitation learning should do — including the teacher's mistakes.

The obvious next step to go **beyond** the heuristic ceiling is RL with the environment's native reward signal — GRPO or PPO against the same rubric — which is the natural Round 3 work.

---

## 6. The surprise finding — scale is the story

I ran the exact same pipeline with the smaller **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** backbone (same environment, same seeds, same heuristic teacher, same reward rubric). The story flips entirely:

![Reward curve for the 0.5B ablation — SFT barely improves over base and never closes a hard incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwapnilPatil28/Multi-Agent-Incident-Command-Center/main/artifacts/reward_curve_qwen0p5b.png)

| Task | Random | Base **0.5B** | **SFT 0.5B** | Heuristic | SFT − Base (0.5B) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| easy | −5.96 | −2.92 | **−2.49** | −4.72 | **+0.43** |
| medium | −11.48 | −4.00 | **−3.86** | −0.87 | **+0.14** |
| hard | −12.50 | −2.40 | **−2.40** | +5.89 | **+0.00** |

**The punchline:** with a 0.5B backbone, SFT delivers only a **+0.43 / +0.14 / +0.00** improvement over the base model and **never closes a single hard incident**. Bumping the backbone to **1.5B** — same SFT code, same data pipeline, same environment — unlocks a **−1.80 / +3.13 / +10.17** improvement and makes the LLM match the heuristic's component-for-component behavior on hard incidents.

| Run config | 0.5B | **1.5B (headline)** |
|---|---|---|
| Base model | Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct | Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct |
| Episodes / task (rollout) | 3 | 8 |
| Dataset rows | 255 | 680 |
| Train epochs | 1 | 3 |
| Base → SFT improvement on **hard** | **+0.00** | **+10.17** |
| Hard incidents closed by SFT | **0** | **full heuristic behavior** |

**Interpretation:** at 0.5B the model is *too small* to absorb this multi-step, role-gated policy from SFT, even though it can emit syntactically valid JSON. At 1.5B the capacity suddenly becomes sufficient to internalise the full action schedule, and behavior cloning converges. **This is the kind of finding the environment is designed to surface — the composable rubric makes it visible in one plot, not hidden behind a single aggregate score.**

## 8. What's next

- **Replace SFT with GRPO or PPO** using the environment's native reward signal — no heuristic teacher, let the rubric itself shape the policy and push past the imitation ceiling.
- **Scale the incident catalog** from 13 templates to 50+ (drop in JSON-defined scenarios).
- **Add a second "adversarial" agent** that injects misleading signals to test robustness.
- **Record the 2-minute walkthrough** from [`docs/VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`](https://github.com/SwapnilPatil28/Multi-Agent-Incident-Command-Center/blob/main/docs/VIDEO_SCRIPT.md) as a bonus companion to this writeup.

If you want to run it yourself, the Space and the repo are fully self-contained — `docker run` the image and point any OpenEnv-compatible client at it. Or just hit `/reset` and `/step` yourself from any language that can speak HTTP JSON.
